## Description

The 0x0D-preprocessor project explores the concept of the preprocessor in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of preprocessor directives, macros, and their usage in C programs.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Including header files using the `#include` directive.
- Defining and using macros for code generation and substitution.
- Understanding and utilizing conditional compilation using directives like `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif`.
- Utilizing predefined macros for information retrieval, such as `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__DATE__`, and `__TIME__`.

Understanding the preprocessor and its capabilities is essential for building flexible, modular, and maintainable C programs.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-object_like_macro.h](./0-object_like_macro.h/): Header file that defines a macro `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
- [1-pi.h](./1-pi.h/): Header file that defines a macro `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
- [2-main.c](./2-main.c/): Program that prints the name of the source file it was compiled from.
- [3-function_like_macro.h](./3-function_like_macro.h/): Header file that defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
- [4-sum.h](./4-sum.h/): Header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of two numbers `x` and `y`.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x0D-preprocessor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-object_like_macro.h/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
