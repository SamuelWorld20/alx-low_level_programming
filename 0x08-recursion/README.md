## Description

The 0x08-recursion project explores the concept of recursion in C. Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of recursion and how to use it effectively to solve complex problems.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Writing recursive functions to solve mathematical problems.
- Using recursion to traverse and manipulate data structures like linked lists and trees.
- Understanding the base case and recursive case in recursive functions.
- Implementing recursive algorithms for common programming challenges.

Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming and is widely used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and data structures.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c/): Function that prints a string followed by a newline using recursion.
- [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c/): Function that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
- [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c/): Function that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c/): Function that computes the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c/): Function that computes the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.
- [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c/): Function that computes the square root of a number using recursion.
- [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c/): Function that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.
- [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c/): Function that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c/): Function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/alx-low_level_programming/0x08-recursion.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-puts_recursion.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
