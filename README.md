## Description

In the ALX Software Engineering program, the focus is on developing a strong foundation in low-level programming. This repository serves as a collection of my progress and achievements in this area. Each project or task is designed to enhance my understanding of low-level programming concepts, improve my problem-solving skills, and familiarize myself with the C programming language.

## Technologies

The projects in this repository are primarily implemented using the C programming language. Some projects may also utilize specific libraries or tools based on the requirements. Commonly used technologies and tools include:

- C programming language
- GCC compiler
- Makefile
- Git version control

## Projects

Here are some of the projects and tasks included in this repository:

- [0x00-hello_world](./0x00-hello_world): Introduction to C programming, compilation process, and basic syntax.
- [0x01-variables_if_else_while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while): Learning about variables, if-else statements, and loops in C.
- [0x02-functions_nested_loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops): Implementing functions and nested loops in C.
- [0x03-debugging](./0x03-debugging): Understanding and practicing debugging techniques.
- [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops): Further exploration of functions and nested loops.
