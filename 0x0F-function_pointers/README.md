## Description

The 0x0F-function_pointers project explores the concept of function pointers in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of function pointers and their usage in C programs.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Defining function pointers to reference functions dynamically.
- Passing function pointers as arguments to other functions.
- Utilizing function pointers to implement different behaviors at runtime.
- Understanding the flexibility and power of function pointers in function callbacks.

Understanding function pointers is essential for building more flexible and extensible C programs that can adapt their behavior based on dynamic decisions.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-print_name.c](./0-print_name.c/): Function that prints a name using a function pointer.
- [1-array_iterator.c](./1-array_iterator.c/): Function that executes a function on each element of an array.
- [2-int_index.c](./2-int_index.c/): Function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer as the comparison function.
- [3-calc.h](./3-calc.h/): Header file that contains function prototypes for a simple calculator program.
- [3-op_functions.c](./3-op_functions.c/): Function implementations for the calculator operations.
- [3-get_op_func.c](./3-get_op_func.c/): Function that selects the appropriate function to perform a calculation.
- [100-main_opcodes.c](./100-main_opcodes.c/): A program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/alx-low_level_programming/0x0F-function_pointers.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-print_name.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
