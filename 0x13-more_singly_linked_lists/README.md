## Description

The 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists project builds upon the concept of singly linked lists in C. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node points to the next node in the list. The programs in this repository aim to expand your understanding of linked lists and explore more complex operations.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Inserting and deleting nodes at different positions in the list.
- Reversing the order of nodes in the list.
- Finding the length of a linked list.
- Implementing recursive operations on linked lists.

Linked lists are versatile data structures used in various algorithms and applications, and understanding advanced linked list operations is crucial for efficient data management.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-print_listint.c](./0-print_listint.c/): Function that prints all the elements of a listint_t linked list.
- [1-listint_len.c](./1-listint_len.c/): Function that returns the number of elements in a listint_t linked list.
- [2-add_nodeint.c](./2-add_nodeint.c/): Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t linked list.
- [3-add_nodeint_end.c](./3-add_nodeint_end.c/): Function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t linked list.
- [4-free_listint.c](./4-free_listint.c/): Function that frees the memory used by a listint_t linked list.
- [5-free_listint2.c](./5-free_listint2.c/): Function that frees the memory used by a listint_t linked list and sets the head to NULL.
- [6-pop_listint.c](./6-pop_listint.c/): Function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list and returns its data.
- [7-get_nodeint.c](./7-get_nodeint.c/): Function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
- [8-sum_listint.c](./8-sum_listint.c/): Function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
- [9-insert_nodeint.c](./9-insert_nodeint.c/): Function that inserts a new node at a given position in a listint_t linked list.
- [10-delete_nodeint.c](./10-delete_nodeint.c/): Function that deletes a node at a given position in a listint_t linked list.
- [100-reverse_listint.c](./100-reverse_listint.c/): Function that reverses a listint_t linked list.
- [101-print_listint_safe.c](./101-print_listint_safe.c/): Function that prints a listint_t linked list safely.
- [102-free_listint_safe.c](./102-free_listint_safe.c/): Function that frees a listint_t linked list safely.
- [103-find_loop.c](./103-find_loop.c/): Function that finds the loop in a listint_t linked list.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started
