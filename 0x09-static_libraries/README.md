## Description

The 0x09-static_libraries project explores the concept of static libraries in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of static libraries, their creation, and how to use them in your C projects.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Creating static libraries from object files.
- Linking your C programs with static libraries.
- Understanding the benefits and usage of static libraries.
- Organizing and modularizing your code using libraries.

Using static libraries allows you to reuse code across multiple projects, resulting in more efficient and maintainable codebases.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [libmy.a](./libmy.a/): A static library containing various functions implemented in previous projects.
- [main.h](./main.h/): A header file containing function prototypes for the functions in `libmy.a.a`.
- [create_static_lib.sh](./create_static_lib.sh/): A shell script to automate the creation of a static library.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `*.c` and `*.h`, as well as the script file for library creation.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x09-static_libraries.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd libholberton.a/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Compile the library using the provided script: `./create_static_lib.sh`
5. Implement your C program and link it with the static library.
6. Compile your program, ensuring you link against the static library.
7. Run your program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
