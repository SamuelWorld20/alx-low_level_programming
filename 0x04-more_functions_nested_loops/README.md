## Description

The 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops project builds upon your knowledge of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. The programs in this repository are designed to further enhance your problem-solving skills and strengthen your understanding of these concepts.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice implementing functions with different functionalities, such as checking for uppercase characters, digits, or performing mathematical operations. You will also use nested loops to draw shapes, print specific patterns, and solve various problems.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- `0-main.c`: Main file to test the functions.
- `0-isupper.c`: Function that checks for uppercase characters.
- `1-isdigit.c`: Function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- `2-mul.c`: Function that multiplies two integers.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: Function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4).
- `5-more_numbers.c`: Function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.
- `6-print_line.c`: Function that draws a straight line using the `\` character.
- `7-print_diagonal.c`: Function that draws a diagonal line using the `\` character.
- `8-print_square.c`: Function that prints a square using the `#` character.
- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
- `10-print_triangle.c`: Function that prints a triangle using the `#` character.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-isupper.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.
