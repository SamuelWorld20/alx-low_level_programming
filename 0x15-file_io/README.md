## Description

The 0x15-file_io project explores the concept of file input and output operations in C. File I/O is a crucial skill for interacting with files on a computer system. It involves reading data from files, writing data to files, and manipulating files to store and retrieve information.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will gain practical experience in:

- Reading text files and displaying their content.
- Creating new files and writing content to them.
- Appending data to existing files.
- Copying the content of one file to another.
- Understanding the structure of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

File I/O operations are essential for a wide range of applications, from data processing to configuration management.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-read_textfile.c](./0-read_textfile.c/): Program that reads a text file and displays its content to the standard output.
- [1-create_file.c](./1-create_file.c/): Program that creates a file and writes specified content to it.
- [2-append_text_to_file.c](./2-append_text_to_file.c/): Program that appends text to the end of an existing file.
- [3-cp.c](./3-cp.c/): Program that copies the content of one file to another.
- [100-elf_header.c](./100-elf_header.c/): Program that displays the header information of an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x15-file_io.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-read_textfile.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.

## Usage

Each project's README file provides instructions on how to compile and run the programs. For example, to compile and run the `0-read_textfile.c` program, follow the instructions in the project's README file:

Replace `filename.txt` with the name of the text file you want to read.
