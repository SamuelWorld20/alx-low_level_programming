## Description

The 0x12-singly_linked_lists project explores the concept of singly linked lists in C. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes where each node points to the next node in the list. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of linked lists and how to manipulate them.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Creating and manipulating singly linked lists.
- Inserting and deleting nodes in the list.
- Traversing the list to access and modify data.
- Understanding the basic operations and algorithms used in linked list manipulation.

Understanding singly linked lists is essential for building more complex data structures and efficiently managing data in dynamic scenarios.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-print_list.c](./0-print_list.c/): Function that prints all the elements of a linked list.
- [1-list_len.c](./1-list_len.c/): Function that returns the number of elements in a linked list.
- [2-add_node.c](./2-add_node.c/): Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list.
- [3-add_node_end.c](./3-add_node_end.c/): Function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list.
- [4-free_list.c](./4-free_list.c/): Function that frees the memory used by a linked list.
- [100-first.c](./100-first.c/): Function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n
- [101-hello_holberton.asm](./101-hello_holberton.asm/): A 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/alx-low_level_programming/0x12-singly_linked_lists.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-print_list.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
