## Description

The 0x18-dynamic_libraries project explores the concept of dynamic libraries in C, also known as shared libraries. Dynamic libraries are files containing compiled code that can be loaded and linked to a program at runtime. They provide modularity and code reuse, making it possible to share code among multiple programs.

In this project, you will learn how to:

- Create and compile dynamic libraries.
- Link programs to dynamic libraries at runtime.
- Use the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to specify library search paths.
- Understand the advantages and use cases of dynamic libraries over static libraries.
- Build modular C programs by separating code into libraries.

Dynamic libraries are commonly used in large software projects to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. By mastering this concept, you will be better equipped to work on complex C programs and contribute to larger codebases.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-create_dynamic_lib.sh](./0-create_dynamic_lib.sh/): A shell script that creates a dynamic library from a set of C source files.
- [1-create_dynamic_lib.sh](./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh/): A shell script that creates a dynamic library from a set of C source files and renames it.
- [100-operations.so](./100-operations.so/): A dynamic library that contains various mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- [101-make_me_win.sh](./101-make_me_win.sh/): A shell script that generates a dynamic library that can be loaded by a program to win the `98`-style adventure game.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program or script. You will find the original source code files, shell scripts, and any additional resources needed to complete the projects.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Ensure that you understand the problem statement, implement the necessary code or scripts, and test your solutions for correctness.

## Getting Started
