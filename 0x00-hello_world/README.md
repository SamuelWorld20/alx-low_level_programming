## Description

In the "0x00-hello_world" project, you will find introductory exercises and programs to get started with C programming. The goal is to become familiar with the compilation process, basic syntax, and writing simple programs using the C language.

## Technologies

The projects in this repository are implemented using the following technologies:

- C programming language
- GCC compiler

## Files

The "0x00-hello_world" project contains the following files:

- **0-preprocessor**: This file demonstrates the use of the C preprocessor to manipulate the source code before compilation.
- **1-compiler**: This file shows how to compile a C source code file into an executable program using the GCC compiler.
- **2-assembler**: This file explores the compilation process and how the GCC compiler translates C code into assembly code.
- **3-name**: This file contains a C program that prints the name of the compilation object file.
- **4-puts.c**: This file contains a C program that uses the `puts` function to print a string to the standard output.
- **5-printf.c**: This file contains a C program that uses the `printf` function to print formatted text to the standard output.
- **6-size.c**: This file contains a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
