## Description

The 0x0B-malloc_free project explores the concepts of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of memory management and provide hands-on experience in using `malloc` to allocate memory and `free` to release memory.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Dynamically allocating memory for variables, arrays, and structures.
- Manipulating dynamically allocated memory using pointers.
- Handling memory allocation errors and ensuring proper memory deallocation.
- Implementing functions that allocate and deallocate memory as needed.

Understanding dynamic memory management is crucial for building programs that can handle variable amounts of data and optimize memory usage.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-create_array.c](./0-create_array.c/): Function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character.
- [1-strdup.c](./1-strdup.c/): Function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, containing a copy of the given string.
- [2-str_concat.c](./2-str_concat.c/): Function that concatenates two strings.
- [3-alloc_grid.c](./3-alloc_grid.c/): Function that returns a pointer to a 2D array of integers.
- [4-free_grid.c](./4-free_grid.c/): Function that frees a 2D grid previously allocated by the `alloc_grid` function.
- [5-argstostr.c](./5-argstostr.c/): Function that concatenates all the arguments of a program into a single string.
- [100-strtow.c](./100-strtow.c/): Function that splits a string into words and returns a pointer to an array of strings.
- [101-strtow.c](./101-strtow.c/): Fuunction that splits a string into words and returns `NULL` if string is empty or `NULL`.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x0B-malloc_free.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-create_array.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
