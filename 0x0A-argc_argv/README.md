## Description

The 0x0A-argc_argv project explores the usage of the `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector) parameters in the `main` function in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of command-line arguments and how to process them in your C programs.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Accessing and processing command-line arguments passed to your program.
- Handling different argument counts and variations.
- Parsing and validating command-line inputs.
- Implementing functionality based on the provided arguments.

Understanding how to work with command-line arguments is essential for building programs that can be controlled and customized from the command line, allowing users to provide inputs and customize program behavior.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c/): Program that prints its own name.
- [1-args.c](./1-args.c/): Program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
- [2-args.c](./2-args.c/): Program that prints all arguments it receives.
- [3-mul.c](./3-mul.c/): Program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments.
- [4-add.c](./4-add.c): Program that adds positive numbers passed as arguments.
- [100-change.c](./100-change.c/): Program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for a given amount.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x0A-argc_argv.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-whatsmyname.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and provide the necessary command-line arguments.
7. Verify that the program produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
