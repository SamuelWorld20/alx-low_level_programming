# 0x0C-more_malloc_free

Welcome to the 0x0C-more_malloc_free project repository! This repository contains C programs that focus on dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and memory deallocation using `free` in the C programming language.

## Description

The 0x0C-more_malloc_free project builds upon your understanding of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your knowledge and skills in manipulating memory and working with various memory allocation functions.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Allocating memory for variables, arrays, and structures using `malloc`.
- Allocating and initializing memory blocks using `calloc`.
- Adjusting the size of dynamically allocated memory using `realloc`.
- Ensuring proper memory deallocation using `free`.
- Handling memory allocation errors and ensuring error-free memory management.

Understanding dynamic memory allocation is crucial for building programs that can adapt to varying data sizes and efficiently manage memory resources.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-malloc_checked.c](./0-malloc_checked.c/): Function that allocates memory using `malloc`.
- [1-string_nconcat.c](./1-string_nconcat.c/): Function that concatenates two strings.
- [2-calloc.c](./2-calloc.c/): Function that allocates memory for an array, using `calloc`.
- [3-array_range.c](./3-array_range.c/): Function that creates an array of integers.
- [100-realloc.c](./100-realloc.c/): Function that reallocates a memory block using `realloc`.
- [101-mul.c](./101-mul.c/): A program that multiplies two positive numbers.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x0C-more_malloc_free.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-malloc_checked.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
