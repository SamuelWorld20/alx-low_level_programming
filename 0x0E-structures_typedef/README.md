## Description

The 0x0E-structures_typedef project explores the concepts of structures and typedef in C. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of structures, how to define them, and how to use typedef to create aliases for custom data types.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Defining and using structures to hold multiple related data elements.
- Initializing and accessing structure members.
- Creating aliases for complex data types using `typedef`.
- Working with functions that use structures and typedef.

Understanding structures and typedef is essential for building complex data structures and making code more readable and maintainable.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [dog.h](./dog.h/): Header file that defines a new type `struct dog` containing information about a dog.
- [1-init_dog.c](./1-init_dog.c/): Function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.
- [2-print_dog.c](./2-print_dog.c/): Function that prints a `struct dog`.
- [4-new_dog.c](./4-new_dog.c/): Function that creates a new `struct dog`.
- [5-free_dog.c](./5-free_dog.c/): Function that frees memory allocated for a `struct dog`.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x0E-structures_typedef.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd dog.h/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
