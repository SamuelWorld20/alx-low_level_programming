## Description

The 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings project builds upon your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. The programs in this repository aim to strengthen your knowledge and skills in manipulating and working with these fundamental concepts.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Accessing and modifying values using pointers.
- Working with arrays and manipulating their elements.
- Performing string operations, such as copying, concatenating, and comparing strings.
- Implementing functions to handle strings and arrays efficiently.

These exercises will help you gain confidence in working with pointers, arrays, and strings, which are essential skills for developing robust and efficient C programs.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c/): Function that takes a pointer to an integer and updates the value it points to.
- [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c/): Function that swaps the values of two integers.
- [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c/): Function that returns the length of a string.
- [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c/): Function that prints a string to stdout.
- [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c/): Function that prints a string in reverse.
- [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c/): Function that reverses a string.
- [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c/): Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
- [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c/): Function that prints the second half of a string.
- [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c/): Function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers.
- [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c/): Function that copies a string to another buffer.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-reset_to_98.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
