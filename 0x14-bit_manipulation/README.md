## Description

The 0x14-bit_manipulation project explores the concept of bit manipulation in C. Bit manipulation is a powerful technique that involves modifying individual bits within a binary representation of data. The programs in this repository aim to deepen your understanding of bitwise operations and their applications.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Setting, clearing, and toggling bits in integers.
- Checking the value of specific bits.
- Shifting bits to the left or right.
- Using bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR) for various operations.

Bit manipulation is crucial in low-level programming and is often used in fields such as embedded systems, device drivers, and cryptography.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c/): Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned integer.
- [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c/): Function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c/): Function that gets the value of a bit at a given index.
- [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c/): Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c/): Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c/): Function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.
- [100-get_endianness.c](./100-get_endianness.c/): Function that checks the endianness of the system.
- [101-password](./101-password): Password to a program

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code files, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x14-bit_manipulation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-binary_to_uint.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to seek help. Learning and problem-solving are iterative processes, and collaboration can greatly enhance your progress.
