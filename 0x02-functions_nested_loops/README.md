## Description

The "0x02-functions_nested_loops" project provides exercises and programs aimed at developing an understanding of functions and nested loops in C. These concepts are fundamental in programming and crucial for building complex algorithms and solving problems efficiently.

## Technologies

The projects in this repository are implemented using the following technologies:

- C programming language
- GCC compiler

## Files

The "0x02-functions_nested_loops" project contains the following files:

- ***0-putchar.c*: A C program that prints the string ""_putchar followed by a new line
- **1-alphabet.c**: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase using the `_putchar` function and a nested loop.
- **2-print_alphabet_x10.c**: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times using the `_putchar` function and nested loops.
- **3-islower.c**: A C function that checks if a given character is lowercase.
- **4-isalpha.c**: A C function that checks if a given character is an alphabetic letter.
- **5-sign.c**: A C function that prints the sign of a given number (+, -, or 0).
- **6-abs.c**: A C function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- **7-print_last_digit.c**: A C function that prints the last digit of a number.
- **8-24_hours.c**: A C function that prints every minute of a day in 24-hour format.
- **9-times_table.c**: A C function that prints the times table of a given number.
- **10-add.c**: A C function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- **11-print_to_98.c**: A C function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98.
- **100-times_table.c**: A more advanced C function that prints a times table of a given size.
- **101-natural.c**: A C program that computes and prints the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
- **102-fibonacci.c**: A C program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
- **103-fibonacci.c**: A more advanced C program that prints the sum of the even-valued Fibonacci numbers not exceeding 4,000,000.

Feel free to explore each file to understand the code implementation and grasp the concepts.

## Setup

To run the programs in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x02-functions_nested_loops.git

2. Navigate to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x02-functions_nested_loops

3. Choose the desired program file and compile it using the GCC compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-putchar.c -o putchar

This will generate an executable file named "putchar" in the current directory.
