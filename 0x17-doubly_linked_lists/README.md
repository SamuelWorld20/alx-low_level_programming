# 0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists

## Description

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. It focuses on the implementation and usage of Doubly Linked Lists in C.

A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements in which each element contains references (links) to the previous and the next element in the sequence. This project covers various operations that can be performed on doubly linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a doubly linked list and how to use it
- How to use doubly linked lists for various tasks in C programming
- How to implement basic operations (insertion, deletion) on doubly linked lists
- The advantages and disadvantages of using doubly linked lists compared to singly linked lists

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

1. Change your current directory to the project directory:

```shell
cd 0x17-doubly_linked_lists
```

2. You can now compile the C files and create the executable:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o doubly_linked_list
```

3. Run the program:

```shell
./doubly_linked_list
```

## Project Files

The project contains the following source files:

- 0-print_dlistint.c: Function to print all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- 1-dlistint_len.c: Function to count the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- 2-add_dnodeint.c: Function to add a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- 3-add_dnodeint_end.c: Function to add a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- 4-free_dlistint.c: Function to free the memory used by a doubly linked list.
- 5-get_dnodeint.c: Function to get the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- 6-sum_dlistint.c: Function to calculate the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.
- 7-insert_dnodeint.c: Function to insert a new node at a given position in a doubly 
- 8-delete_dnodeint.c: Function to delete a node at a given position in a doubly linked 
- 100-password: A text file containing the password for the Crackme5 challenge.

You can explore other functions by modifying the main function in the doubly_linked_list program.
