## Description

The purpose of the 0x03-debugging project is to provide you with hands-on experience in identifying and fixing bugs in C programs. Debugging is an essential skill for software developers, as it allows you to find and resolve issues in your code, ensuring that it functions correctly.

In this repository, you will find a collection of C programs with known bugs. Your task is to analyze the code, identify the bugs, and fix them to make the programs work as intended. Each program may have one or more bugs, which could include logical errors, syntax errors, or runtime errors.

By working on these debugging exercises, you will sharpen your problem-solving skills, gain a deeper understanding of the C programming language, and become more proficient in locating and resolving bugs in your code.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-main.c](./0-main.c/)
- [1-main.c](./1-main.c/)
- [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c/)
- [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c/)

Each project directory contains a detailed README file that provides information about the specific bug(s) to fix and the expected behavior of the program. Additionally, you will find the original code file with the bug(s) and a corrected version of the file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the debugging exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SamuelWorld20/0x03-debugging.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-positive_or_negative/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and information about the bug(s) to fix.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and analyze the code to identify the bug(s).
5. Make the necessary changes to fix the bug(s) and ensure that the program functions correctly.
6. Compile and run the program to verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to explore and work on the debugging exercises in any order you prefer. Remember to test your code thoroughly and make sure it handles various scenarios and edge cases.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, don't hesitate to ask for help. Debugging can sometimes be challenging, but it's a valuable skill that will greatly benefit your programming journey.
