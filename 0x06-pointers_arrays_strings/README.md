## Description

The 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings project builds upon your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. The programs in this repository aim to strengthen your knowledge and skills in manipulating and working with these fundamental concepts.

By working on the exercises in this project, you will practice tasks such as:

- Working with arrays and manipulating their elements.
- Using pointers to access and modify values in arrays and strings.
- Implementing string-related functions, such as finding the length, copying, concatenating, and comparing strings.
- Understanding the relationship between pointers, arrays, and strings.

These exercises will help you gain confidence in working with pointers, arrays, and strings, which are essential skills for developing robust and efficient C programs.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [0-strcat.c](./0-strcat.c/): Function that concatenates two strings.
- [1-strncat.c](./1-strncat.c/): Function that concatenates two strings, using at most `n` bytes from the source string.
- [2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c/): Function that copies a string, using at most `n` bytes from the source string.
- [3-strcmp.c](./3-strcmp.c/): Function that compares two strings.
- [4-rev_array.c](./4-rev_array.c/): Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
- [5-string_toupper.c](./5-string_toupper.c/): Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- [6-cap_string.c](./6-cap_string.c/): Function that capitalizes all words of a string.
- [7-leet.c](./7-leet.c/): Function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) format.
- [8-rot13.c](./8-rot13.c/): Function that encodes a string using the rot13 cipher.
- [100-print_number.c](./100-print_number.c/): Function that prints an integer.

Each project directory contains a detailed README file with instructions and requirements for the program. You will find the original source code file, such as `main.c`, and a corresponding header file if applicable.

Feel free to explore each project, read the README file, and work on the exercises in any order you prefer. Make sure to understand the problem statement, implement the necessary functions, and test your code to ensure correctness.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice: `cd 0-strcat.c/`
3. Read the README file in the project directory for instructions and requirements.
4. Open the corresponding source code file (e.g., `main.c`) and implement the necessary functions.
5. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
6. Run the program and verify that it produces the expected output.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of the concepts and explore different solutions.
