## Description

The "0x01-variables_if_else_while" project provides exercises and programs aimed at developing an understanding of variables, if-else statements, and while loops in C. These concepts are fundamental building blocks in programming and essential for problem-solving and logic implementation.

## Technologies

The projects in this repository are implemented using the following technologies:

- C programming language
- GCC compiler

## Files

The "0x01-variables_if_else_while" project contains the following files:

- **0-positive_or_negative.c**: A C program that checks if a random number is positive, negative, or zero, and displays the result.
- **1-last_digit.c**: A C program that prints the last digit of a random number and checks if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.
- **2-print_alphabet.c**: A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.
- **3-print_alphabets.c**: A C program that prints the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using a while loop.
- **4-print_alphabt.c**: A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet except the letters 'q' and 'e' using a while loop.
- **5-print_numbers.c**: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers using a while loop.
- **6-print_numberz.c**: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers using the `putchar` function and without using a variable of type `char`.
- **7-print_tebahpla.c**: A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a while loop.
- **8-print_base16.c**: A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase using a while loop.
- **9-print_comb.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using a while loop.
- **100-print_comb3.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using nested while loops.
- **101-print_comb4.c**: A C program that prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers using nested while loops.

Feel free to explore each file to understand the code implementation and grasp the concepts.
